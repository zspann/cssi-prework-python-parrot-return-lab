# Parrot

## Objectives
1. Define a method that accepts arguments.
2. Create a default argument.
3. Practice returning a value.

##Instructions

In this lab you'll be defining a method called `#parrot`. 

The `#parrot` method should accept an argument of a string and both `#print` out that string *and* return the string at the end of the method. 

The `#parrot` method should have a default argument of `"Squawk!"`. 

**Note:** *This lab is explicitly testing your ability to control the return value of a method, not just what it does, but what it returns. Remember, return values are important. Ask yourself? what is the return value of `#print`?*
